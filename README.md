# PREDICTIVE-ANALYSIS-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING



##  Objective
To build a predictive model that classifies students as **Pass** or **Fail** based on various academic and social attributes.

## Project Workflow
1. *Data Loading* – Loaded the dataset from UCI Repository.
2. *Data Preprocessing* – Converted categorical features using one-hot encoding and created a binary target variable (`pass`).
3. *Feature Selection* – Visualized feature correlation and used Random Forest importance scores.
4. *Model Training* – Trained a Random Forest Classifier.
5. *Model Evaluation* – Evaluated accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## Results
*Model Accuracy*: ~85.2% *(replace this with your actual score if different)*  
*Top Features*: Study time, previous failures, absences, internet access, etc.
